## Web Enumeration

Looking at this page, anything typed into the Markdown box gets converted into a PDF file.

I suspected the PDF conversion feature could be abused for **SSRF**. To confirm, I hosted a Python HTTP server on my own machine:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

When I submitted content, the target made requests to me â€” confirming the backend fetched external resources.

## Exploit

Next, I tested internal resources by embedding an iframe pointing to localhost. Since Nmap showed port 5000 open and dirsearch revealed `/admin`, I used this payload inside the Markdown box:

```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:5000/admin"></iframe>
```

When converted to a PDF, the server rendered the page it fetched from its own localhost. That gave me direct access to the `/admin` interface.

Inside the PDF output, I found the flag.
