# Corridor

You have found yourself in a strange corridor. Can you find your way back to where you came?

In this challenge, you will explore potential IDOR vulnerabilities. Examine the URL endpoints you access as you navigate the website and note the hexadecimal values you find (they look an awful lot like a hash, don't they?). This could help you uncover website locations you were not expected to access.

nmap scan 

```abap
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63
```

Going into the website we get a image of corridors and when we click each one it gives a set path and a empty roomâ€™

Looking at the hint above we know that the paths are all hashes. After copying down all the hashes and dehashing them we get this

```abap

e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5	md5	5
1679091c5a880faf6fb5e6087eb1b2dc	md5	6

c9f0f895fb98ab9159f51fd0297e236d	md5	8
```

Which got me thinking we can hash a number and change the parameter. I know its a md5 hash. 

So lets try 0 with this easy command

```abap
echo -n "0" | md5sum
