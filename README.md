# 🛡️ TryHackMe Write-Ups by Shabha

Welcome to my collection of TryHackMe write-ups! This repository serves as a personal learning journal, a knowledge base for the cybersecurity community, and a way to grow my presence in the infosec world.

## 📌 Why I’m Doing This

I'm actively working through TryHackMe rooms to strengthen my hands-on cybersecurity skills, reinforce what I’ve learned, and improve my ability to break down and explain technical challenges clearly. These write-ups are not just notes for myself—they're also created to:

- Help others who may be stuck on similar challenges
- Build an online presence and show my growth over time
- Contribute to the CTF and hacking community
- Prepare for real-world cybersecurity roles and interviews

## 🎯 Who This Is For

These write-ups are meant for:

- Fellow TryHackMe players looking for hints, breakdowns, or alternative approaches
- Recruiters and professionals interested in my skill development
- CTF learners and cybersecurity beginners
- Anyone curious about offensive security, OSINT, Linux, web, enumeration, and more

## 🔄 How Often I Post

I aim to post **at least one new write-up every week**, covering a wide range of rooms and categories including:

- OSINT
- Web exploitation
- Privilege escalation
- Linux enumeration
- Realistic attack simulations
- And everything else I can get my hands on

## 📂 Structure

Each folder or file represents a TryHackMe room. Inside, you'll find:

- A step-by-step explanation of my process
- Screenshots (when appropriate)
- Questions and answers (clearly marked)
- Lessons learned and reflections

## ✍️ Disclaimer

These write-ups are intended for **educational purposes only**. I respect TryHackMe's policies and encourage everyone to avoid sharing direct flag answers. The goal is to explain the **process**, not just the result.
